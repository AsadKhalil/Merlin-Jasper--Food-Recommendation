## :innocent: Motivation
- Early identification of at-risk customers: By predicting which customers are likely to cancel their subscriptions 10 days in advance, the company can proactively reach out to those customers and try to retain them.

- Improved customer retention: By identifying and addressing the reasons why customers are canceling their subscriptions, the company can improve its retention rate and reduce customer churn.

- Reduced revenue loss: Canceled subscriptions result in a loss of revenue for the company. By predicting and preventing cancellations, the company can maintain a steady revenue stream.

- Increased customer lifetime value: Retaining customers for longer periods can increase the overall lifetime value of each customer, resulting in long-term financial benefits for the company.

- Data-driven decision making: By using data to predict and prevent customer churn, the company can make more informed decisions about its customer retention strategies.
